# Toronto Airbnb - Using Machine Learning

## History of Airbnb
"Airbnb happened because two guys could not pay their rent, but did have some space." That's how Air-bed and breakfast(Airbnb) started when Joe and Martin from San Francisco rented out their three airbeds to make some cash. Since then, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique and personalized way.
## Introduction
The story of Airbnb's foundation is fascinating. Airbnb is a hospitality service which enables people to lease or rent short-term accommodation. The company does not own any lodging. It is merely an agent. It receives a percentage service fees (commission) from both guests and hosts for every booking. A Host can create a listing by selecting the "Host" menu after logging in. Price for the listing is decided by the host. Host can charge different prices for nightly, weekly, and monthly stays. Host then add a description of the residence, amenities, available dates, cancellation policies, and any house rules. Potential guests are required to message the host directly through Airbnb to ask questions regarding the property. After the reservation, the hosts coordinate meeting times and contact information with the guests. Airbnb guests can leave a review and rate a listing after their stay. This rating can be used as an indicator of their experience during the stay.
